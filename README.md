Hubbot_Twisted
==============

A rewrite of NopeBot in Twisted, using PyMoronBot as a starting point.

If you want to use this, you'll need Python 2.
Some of the functions (hugs/headcanon) rely on a sqlite3 data/data.db file.
A function for generating a blank file for these is included (newDB.py)

GlobalVars.py contains the connection info, admins, and other general configuration for the bot.

The bot can be started by running BotHandler.py
